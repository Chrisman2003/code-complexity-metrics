This section provides a high-level, algorithmic overview of how the project analyzes code and calculates complexity metrics.

Step 1: Preprocessing and Tokenization
The tool starts by reading the target source code file (e.g., complex.cpp). It then tokenizes the code, breaking it down into a list of individual words, symbols, and numbers. This process handles comments, whitespace, and string literals, ensuring they don't interfere with the analysis.

Step 2: Cyclomatic Complexity Calculation (Basic Version)
The initial phase of complexity analysis focuses on Cyclomatic Complexity. This metric measures the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code. The algorithm identifies specific keywords and control structures that contribute to the complexity score.

Initialize complexity to 1 (for the single path through the function).

Iterate through the tokenized list of the code.

Increment the complexity counter for each occurrence of the following keywords:

if, for, while, case, catch

The total count represents the basic cyclomatic complexity of the code.

Step 3: Cognitive Complexity Calculation (Basic Version)
This metric is designed to measure the effort required for a developer to understand a piece of code. The current, basic implementation follows a simple additive model.

Initialize cognitive complexity to 0.

Iterate through the tokens of the code.

Add a complexity score for each of the following:

Control Flow Keywords: Add 1 for each if, for, while, and switch.

Nesting: Add 1 for each level of nesting within a loop or conditional block.

The final sum represents the basic cognitive complexity.

Step 4: Halstead Metrics Calculation
The project also computes Halstead Metrics, which are based on counting operators and operands in the source code.

The algorithm counts unique operators (η_1) and total operators (N_1).

It also counts unique operands (η_2) and total operands (N_2).

These four values are then used to calculate various Halstead metrics, such as:

Program Length: N=N_1+N_2

Vocabulary Size: η=η_1+η_2

Volume: V=N×log_2(η)

Difficulty: D=(η_1/2)×(N_2/η_2)

Effort: E=V×D

🗺️ Future Plans
This project is under continuous development. The following features are planned for future releases:

Advanced Cyclomatic and Cognitive Complexity:

The current implementation uses a basic keyword set. Future plans involve expanding the keyword list to include GPGPU-specific constructs from OpenCL, CUDA, and Kokkos. This will allow for more accurate complexity analysis of heterogeneous code.

Expanded GPGPU Language Support:

The goal is to provide comprehensive support for CUDA and Kokkos in addition to OpenCL. This includes a more refined tokenization process that recognizes specific GPGPU-related data types and functions.

Refined Halstead Metrics:

The Halstead metric calculation will be updated to handle GPGPU-specific operators and to provide a more nuanced analysis that distinguishes between different types of operands.

Comprehensive Testing:

The current pytest suite is being updated. Future work will include a more extensive set of test cases to ensure the accuracy and reliability of all metric calculations across different code bases and language extensions.

Updated Dependencies:

Once the advanced implementation is complete, the following system dependencies will be required for full functionality: clinfo, libviennacl-dev, libboost-all-dev, g++, libjsoncpp-dev, ocl-icd-opencl-dev, clc, and libglew-dev.
